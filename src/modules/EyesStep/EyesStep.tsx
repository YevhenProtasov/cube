                <h2>Keep Your Eyes Open</h2>
                <p>
                  Unlike many meditation practices that suggest closing your
                  eyes, Zen meditation emphasizes maintaining an open, gentle
                  gaze. This practice keeps you connected to the present moment
                  and helps avoid mental drifting or drowsiness.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Begin by directing your gaze slightly downward, focusing on
                  the floor about two to three feet in front of you. You don’t
                  need to concentrate on any particular object; instead, let
                  your eyes rest softly, as if you’re looking at the space in
                  front of you. Avoid straining or forcing your gaze—let it be
                  natural and relaxed.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Keeping your eyes open may feel unusual at first, but it
                  allows you to engage fully with your surroundings while
                  remaining deeply centered in your practice. Over time, this
                  approach strengthens your ability to stay present and calm,
                  even in the midst of everyday life.
