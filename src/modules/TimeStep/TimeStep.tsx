                  Zen meditation doesn’t require hours of practice to be
                  effective. Start with just five minutes a day and gradually
                  increase the time as you feel comfortable. Use a timer or a
                  gentle chime to mark the end of your session, so you don’t
                  have to worry about watching the clock.

                  As you meditate, remember that the goal is not perfection but
                  presence. Each moment you spend in stillness, observing your
                  breath and returning to the present, is a step toward
                  mindfulness. Don’t worry if your practice feels
                  imperfect—every session is a valuable part of your journey.
