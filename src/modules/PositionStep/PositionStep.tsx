                  Meditation begins with creating a strong and supportive
                  foundation for your practice. Choose a place to sit where you
                  can remain still and comfortable for an extended period. This
                  could be a cushion on the floor, a meditation bench, or a
                  chair. If sitting on a chair, plant your feet flat on the
                  ground, about hip-width apart.

                  Keep your back straight but not rigid, allowing your spine to
                  follow its natural curve. Think of your spine as a strong yet
                  flexible pillar supporting your posture. Relax your shoulders,
                  letting them fall naturally away from your ears. Rest your
                  hands on your knees or in your lap—whatever feels most natural
                  to you.

                  Your position should feel balanced and grounded. Aim for
                  stability without tension, and comfort without slouching. This
                  upright posture signals to your mind and body that you’re
                  entering a state of calm awareness, ready to focus inward.
