                <h2>Follow Your Breath</h2>
                <p>
                  Breathing is at the heart of meditation, a bridge between your
                  mind and body. In Zen practice, there’s no need to control
                  your breath; instead, observe it as it naturally flows in and
                  out of your body.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Begin by noticing the sensation of your breath entering
                  through your nose and exiting through your mouth. Feel how
                  your chest or abdomen rises and falls with each inhale and
                  exhale. Let your attention rest gently on these sensations,
                  without forcing or altering your breathing in any way.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  If your mind starts to wander, which is natural, bring your
                  focus back to your breath. You might find it helpful to
                  silently count each breath—one on the inhale, two on the
                  exhale—until you reach ten, then begin again. This practice
                  anchors you to the present and cultivates a steady, peaceful
                  awareness.
