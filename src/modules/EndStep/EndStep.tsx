                <p>
                  When your meditation session comes to an end, take a moment to
                  transition gently. Open your eyes fully if they were partially
                  closed, and allow your gaze to take in the room around you.
                  Notice the sensations in your body and how you feel compared
                  to when you began.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Stretch lightly if needed, moving your hands, neck, or
                  shoulders to ease back into activity. Carry the sense of calm
                  and mindfulness you’ve cultivated with you as you continue
                  your day. Remember, the benefits of meditation extend beyond
                  your practice—this state of presence can accompany you in
                  everything you do.
